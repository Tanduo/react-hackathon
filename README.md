## Go get the Project from Github

Go to the following address:

https://github.com/Tanduo/react-hackathon

Choose a location on your computer to put the project. 

ex. c:\DevProjects (windows)

ex. /Users/user/DevProjects/UWGB/react-hackathon (Mac)

Execute the following commands (from terminal) in that directory.

*git clone https://github.com/Tanduo/react-hackathon.git*

The code is now downloaded to your computer in that directory under react-hackathon.

If you run the following commands in that directory you should be able to run the project:

*npm install*

*npm start*

# Basic Project file Structure

### node_modules 

contains any of the specific packages node.js needs to run the application.  Populated by adding apps to package.json and running npm install.

### public

contains index.html

### src

contains all of our source code for the project. Under this directory you will find your readct components, your data files, and your app and index files. Your **App.js** is your starting point for this project.

### .gitignore

contains all files that will big ignored by git checkins.

### package.json

contains any node packages installed for your project.

### README.md

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
